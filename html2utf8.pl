=head1 NAME

html2utf8.pl - convert HTML entities to UTF-8

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perl html2utf8.pl file ...

=head1 USAGE

Provide a list of files, and it converts any HTML character
entities it finds (e.g. &#1104;) into their corresponding UTF-8
characters (e.g. —ê). The original files are modified.

This is mainly useful for VTT files which often contain HTML
entities, but need to be in UTF-8 to display properly as video
subtitles.
